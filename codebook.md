Getting and Cleaning Data Course - Project

This file is about the variables and summaries calculated in the project.

## About Source Data

As source data for the experiment conducted was used Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.

A full description of the original data collected is available at the site:

## Introduction for the analysis on the original data

- "X_train.txt", "y_train.txt" and "subject_train.txt" contain information about training data.
- "X_test.txt", "y_test.txt" and "subjuect_test.txt" contain information about testing data.
- "features.txt" contains names of all measurements.

## Introduction for the R code "run_analysis.R" submmited

CodeBook for the "get_proj_mean.txt" file:

    subject --- the ID of the test subject
    activity --- the type of activity that took place during the measurement
    WALKING (value 1) --- subject walked during measurement
    WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2) --- subject walked upwards during measurement
    WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3) --- subject walked downwards during measurement
    SITTING (value 4) --- subject sat in place during measurement
    STANDING (value 5) --- subject stood in place during measurement
    LAYING (value 6) --- subject layed during measurement
